# Introduction

The *housing_adjustment* project implements my 2013 paper **The Effects of Housing Adjustment Costs on Consumption Dynamics**. That working paper is available on the Office of Financial Research's Staff Discussion Paper website ([link](https://www.financialresearch.gov/staff-discussion-papers/files/OFRsdp2015-03_Effects-of-Housing-Adjustment-Costs-on-Consumption-Dynamics.pdf)).

The code is all in matlab and designed to run in parallel.
